# PART ONE:
# acc increases or decreases a single global value called accumulator by the value given in argument. 
# For example, acc +7 would increase the accumulator by 7. The accumulator starts at 0. 
# After an acc instruction, the instruction immediately below it is executed next.

# jmp jumps to a new instruction relative to itself. 
# The next instruction to execute is found using the argument as an offset from the jmp instruction; 
# for example, jmp +2 would skip the next instruction, jmp +1 would continue to the instruction immediately below it,
# and jmp -20 would cause the instruction 20 lines above to be executed next.

# nop stands for No OPeration - it does nothing. The instruction immediately below it is executed next.

# FIND accumulator val BEFORE IT GOES INTO INFINITE LOOP
